By contributing to this project, you grant me the right to distribute your contribution as follows:

1) to use your contribution in the binary release of this software on the Windows Store, which I may make a profit from, and
2) to make your contribution available under the NetStylus licence, which guarantees it will be available in source code form to the general public under a copyleft-style licence.

In return, I declare that I will distribute your contribution in both ways as described above (i.e. I will always make sure your contribution is available in source code form to the general public under the NetStylus licence).

If you contribution is large and this project by some freakish universe fluke actually generates significant income, I may buy you a beer / send you money on paypal. However if you do make a contribution, you should do it on the assumption that this will not occur.
